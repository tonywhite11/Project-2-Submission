## Instructions

**Getting started.** Clone or download file to local drive. Once the zip file is downloaded, use a zip file extractor to 
extract folder. Open the extracted folder and then open the .html file.

**How to play.** Click on a card to reveal symbol, then click on another card to find it's match. Continue to reveal symbols until
all cards are matched. 

**Objective.** The move counter is increases each time the player attempts to match a card. After 17 attempts the player loses a star and again after the 23rd attempt. The object of the game is to have the most stars with the least amount of moves in the least amount of time.

**Game over.** The game is over when all cards have been matched.

**Replay game.** The player can restart the game by clicking the reset button or by clicking the replay button on the win/game-over screen.
